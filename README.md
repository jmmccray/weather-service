# Weather Service

## Description
Write an http server that uses the Open Weather API that exposes an endpoint that takes in lat/long coordinates. This endpoint should return what the weather condition is outside in that area (snow, rain, etc), whether it’s hot, cold, or moderate outside (use your own discretion on what temperature equates to each type).

The API can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/api. Even though most of the API calls found on OpenWeather aren’t free, you should be able to use the free “current weather data” API call for this project.  First, sign-up for an account, which shouldn’t require credit card or payment information.  Once you’ve created an account, use https://openweathermap.org/faq to get your API Key setup to start using the API.
